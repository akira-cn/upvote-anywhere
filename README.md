```html
<img id="upvoteBtn" src="https://wp2aqcqkj5.us.aircode.run/show?id=64dc8e2885f13fbcd52be970" width="35" style="vertical-align: bottom;cursor:pointer;"> Do you like Upvote Anywhere? If you do, please give it an upvote.

<script>
upvoteBtn.addEventListener('click', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  await fetch('https://wp2aqcqkj5.us.aircode.run/upvote', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({id: '64dc8e2885f13fbcd52be970'}),
  });
  upvoteBtn.src = "https://wp2aqcqkj5.us.aircode.run/show?id=64dc8e2885f13fbcd52be970&t=" + Date.now();
});
</script>
```

## Cookie Policy

Since Upvote Anywhere requires using cookies to track upvote status, when it's used on third-party websites and operated through fetch, it relies on the other party's CORS policy. For instance, CodePen's policy doesn't allow cross-site cookies, which means Upvote Anywhere can't record the voted status. However, we can use a GET request to https://wp2aqcqkj5.us.aircode.run/upvote to store the cookie on the original site, then redirect back to the target URL, just as we've done in our GitHub README.
